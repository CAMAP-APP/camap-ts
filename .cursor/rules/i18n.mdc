- do not hard code strings
- supply meaningful id for translated string
- look for an existing string in `public/locales/translation.json` or any file already loaded in the current module
- if no existing string add it to the most specific file already loaded
- if no file already loaded and a relevant translation file exists for the module, use this file
- if no relevant translation file exists create it and load it
